      <p> On the shores of Lake Simcoe, Creighton Manor was built at the turn of the century by or in honor of Captain Odgen Creighton, a land baron in the village of Atherley. Captain Creigton also had a hand in the Battle of Lundy in 1812 at Niagara Falls. He was at one time the owner of Clifton Hill in Niagara Falls. Since the early 1900 the manor has been home to many families including the upper crust families of Toronto. The manor was mainly a summer escape until around the 1940's when it was insulated and became a year round home. It is said by some of the locals that a family that kept the manor as a summer home were residents of high society. The lady of the house at that time was part of the Toronto Opera and would practice her musical scale on the front porch and her husband was involved in the running of the Toronto Exibition. </p>
      <p> The Manor has been completely renovated from inside to out. It fell into a bit of disrepair over the years and needed some tender loving care. That's where the Thurlbecks come in. Levada and Doug  purchased Creighton Manor in 1995 and have put their heart and soul into lovingly restoring it to the beautiful home it is today. They have decided to share their home with others by way of a Bed &amp; Breakfast. </p>
      <p>  The Creighton Manor Bed &amp; Breakfast has 3 superbly decorated guest rooms all complete with ensuite bathrooms, queen size beds, Egyptian cotton bedding, television, DVD, and include a gourmet breakfast served up by our in house chef. The Tower room will have the most unique shower you will ever see and has been reserved even before it is completed (fall 2007). </p>
    <p>Guests have free range of the wrap around porch and the large gazebo over looking Lake Simcoe, where breakfast is served in summer weather. As you still in the gazebo you'll wonder if there is any better place on earth. At the park there is swimming, sun bathing, or perfect for taking a romantic sunset stroll. The Manor hosts offer marina pick for that special night off the boat. The Manor is the perfect place for that romantic get away or for the bride to be and her entourage for the night before the wedding. Get that perfect picture on the gazebo or over at the water's edge. The beautiful dinning room also doubles as a intimate boardroom for meetings of up to 10 people. </p></td>
